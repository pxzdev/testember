# invoices

Task description: create an "Invoices Tracker" application

### Features (not all have to be implemented, choose whichever you feel are more important):
* create invoices with amount and date
* list invoices and display aggregated totals
* filter invoices by date
* edit invoices
* remove invoices

### Requirements & Notes:
* the time limit is 2 hours, there is no need to spend more on this
* use git and send us a link to the github repository
* we are interested in the decisions you take, the architecture you reach, how well you master the technologies you chose, how is your code organized, your commit history...
* the UI doesn't have to look sharp, or be polished. We are however interested in your styling skills
* we are not interested in a feature complete application
* we are not interested in backend. In-memory, in-page is more than enough
